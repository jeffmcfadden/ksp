// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)

// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)
