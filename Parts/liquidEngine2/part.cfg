description = The LV-T45 engine was considered another breakthrough in the LV-T series, due to its Thrust Vectoring feature. The LV-T45 can deflect its thrust to aid in craft control. All these added mechanics however, make for a slightly smaller and less powerful engine in comparison with earlier LV-T models.
