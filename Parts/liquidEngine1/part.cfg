description = Although criticized by some due to its not unsignificant use of so-called "pieces found lying about", the LV-T series has proven itself as a comparatively reliable engine. The T30 model boasts a failure ratio below the 50% mark. This has been considered a major improvement over previous models by engineers and LV-T enthusiasts.
