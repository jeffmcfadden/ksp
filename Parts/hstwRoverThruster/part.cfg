description = This prograde RCS thruster is little more than a few bits of tubing and a valve, though only two of them are well enough to lift a Mün Rover from the Mün. Comes complete with a ratchet strap for mounting onto a propane tank. Press <R> to turn on, then <H> to fire. Warning: extremely fragile; do not subject to shock!
